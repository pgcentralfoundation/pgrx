/// Represents Postgres' `internal` data type, which is documented as:
///
///    The internal pseudo-type is used to declare functions that are meant only to be called
///    internally by the database system, and not by direct invocation in an SQL query. If a
///    function has at least one internal-type argument then it cannot be called from SQL. To
///    preserve the type safety of this restriction it is important to follow this coding rule: do
///    not create any function that is declared to return internal unless it has at least one
///    internal argument.
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// [Internal] is a wrapper around an `Option<pg_sys::Datum>`, which when retreived via
/// `::get/get_mut()` is cast to a pointer of `T`, returning the respective reference.
///
/// ## Safety
///
/// We make no guarantees about what the internal [pg_sys::Datum] actually points to in memory, so
/// it is your responsibility to ensure that what you're casting it to is really what it is.
