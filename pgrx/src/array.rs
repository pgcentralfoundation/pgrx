/**
An aligned, dereferenceable `NonNull<ArrayType>` with low-level accessors.

It offers safe accessors to the fields of [pg_sys::ArrayType] and mostly-safe accessors
to the "dynamic fields" of the defined Postgres varlena array, but only requires validity
of ArrayType itself and the dimensions slice (always valid if `ndim == 0`).
This means the [NonNull] pointers that are returned may not be valid to read.
Validating the correctness of the entire array requires a bit more effort.

It is not Copy or Clone to make it slightly harder to misuse versus *mut ArrayType.
However, `&mut self` accessors do not give lifetimes to returned [`NonNull<[T]>`][nonnull]!
Instead, these are raw pointers, and `&mut RawArray` only makes `&RawArray` safer.

The reason RawArray works almost entirely with raw pointers is that
it is not currently valid to go from `&mut ArrayType` to `*mut ArrayType`,
take an offset beyond ArrayType's fields, and then create a new slice there
and read from that. The result is currently undefined behavior,
though with emphasis on "undefined": it may become defined in the future of Rust.

At the current moment, however, it is best to exercise an abundance of caution.

# On sizes and subscripts

Postgres uses C's `int` (`c_int` in Rust) for sizes, and Rust uses [usize].
Thus various functions of RawArray return `c_int` values, but you must convert to usize.
On 32-bit or 64-bit machines with 32-bit `c_int`s, you may losslessly upgrade `as usize`,
except with negative indices, which Postgres asserts against creating.
PGRX currently only intentionally supports 64-bit machines,
and while support for ILP32 or I64LP128 C data models may become possible,
PGRX will **not** support 16-bit machines in any practical case, even though Rust does.

    When calling this method, you have to ensure that all of the following is true:
    * The pointer must be properly aligned.
    * It must be "dereferenceable" in the sense defined in [the std documentation].
    * The pointer must point to an initialized instance of [pg_sys::ArrayType].
    * The `ndim` field must be a correct value, or **0**, so `dims` is aligned and readable,
      or no data is actually read at all.
    * This is a unique, "owning pointer" for the varlena, so it won't be aliased while held,
      and it points to data in the Postgres ArrayType format.

    It should be noted that despite all these requirements, RawArray has no lifetime,
    nor produces slices with such, so it can still be racy and unsafe!

    # Safety

    While this function is safe to call, using the slice may risk undefined behavior.
    The raw slice is not guaranteed to be legible at any given index as T,
    e.g. it may be an "SQL null" if so indicated in the null bitmap.
    As a result, it is dangerous to reborrow this as `&[T]` or `&mut [T]`
    unless the type considers all bitpatterns to be valid values.

    That is the primary reason this returns [`NonNull<[T]>`][nonnull]. If it returned `&mut [T]`,
    then for many possible types that can be **undefined behavior**,
    as it would assert each particular index was a valid `T`.
    A Rust borrow, including of a slice, will always be
    * non-null
    * aligned
    * **validly initialized**, except in the case of [MaybeUninit] types
    It is reasonable to assume data Postgres exposes logically to SQL is initialized,
    but it may be incorrect to assume data Postgres has marked "null"
    otherwise follows Rust-level initialization requirements.

    As Postgres handles alignment requirements in its own particular ways,
    it is up to you to validate that each index is aligned correctly.
    The first element should be correctly aligned to the type, but that is not certain.
    Successive indices are even less likely to match the data type you want
    unless Postgres also uses an identical layout.

    This returns a slice to make it somewhat harder to fail to read it correctly.
    However, it should be noted that a len 0 slice may not be read via raw pointers.
