- go make a PR to `develop` on GitHub
- start "draft new release" on GitHub to ask it to "Generate release notes".  Make sure to choose the `develop` branch to get the full set of changes.: https://github.com/tcdi/pgx/releases/new
- paste them into the PR you made above
- edit them as best as you can while channeling @workingjubilee's spirit
- request a review
- do a squash merge into develop

```shell
git switch develop
git pull origin develop --ff-only
git switch master
git pull origin master --ff-only
git merge develop
git push origin master
```

- create the actual release on GitHub, tagging the `master` branch with "${NEW_VERSION}", using the release notes you made in your PR

```shell
./publish.sh
```
