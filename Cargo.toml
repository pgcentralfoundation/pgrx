# Only include line tables in debuginfo. This reduces the size of target/ (after
# running tests) by almost half, while keeping the part of debuginfo which
# people care about the most (the part used to produce backtraces). This seems
# like something we would generally want (when actually running in a debugger
# you can just comment out the line).
#
# That said, if it turns out to hurt development more than expected, we could
# move this to only toggle this in CI
