# Working with PGRX

The basic idea of pgrx is that a Postgres extension requires
- writing a bunch of C code that must manually handle many Postgres invariants
- writing SQL that then loads the extension properly, including many
  [CREATE FUNCTION] and [CREATE TYPE] declarations

This demands programmers who wish to write Postgres extensions to become
experts in C, SQL, and the inner workings of Postgres, on top of having useful
domain knowledge for the actual extension.

Alternatively, with Rust, safe abstractions can be designed to encode the
invariants that Postgres requires in types. Powerful procedural macros can
generate the code to handle the Postgres function ABI, or even write the
needed SQL declarations! This is what pgrx does, with the intent to allow
writing extensions correctly while only being familiar with a single language:
Rust.

...and pgrx. While the annotations that pgrx requires are easy to write, they
aren't necessarily automatic. And even if it is simpler than `pgxs.mk`, the
pgrx build system, primarily wielded through `cargo pgrx`, sometimes needs user
intervention to fix problems. Most of this is in service of allowing you to
adjust exactly how much pgrx assists you, so that it doesn't get in the way
if you need to force something inside it.

<!-- the following may currently be aspirational rather than actual -->
This guide assumes the reader (you) are a Rust programmer, but it does not
expect you to be intimately familiar with Postgres, nor deeply nuanced in FFI.
It may assume familiarity with C and SQL work, but as long as you have written
`extern "C"` or `LEFT JOIN` before, you should be fine.
