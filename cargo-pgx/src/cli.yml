                REQUIREMENTS
                    SQL generation requires some linker flags, as well as a binary.
                    
                    The flags are typically set by a linker script:
                        
                        #! /usr/bin/env bash
                        if [[ $CARGO_BIN_NAME == "sql-generator" ]]; then
                            gcc -Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup,-dynamic-list=$CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/.cargo/pgx-dynamic-list.txt $@
                        else 
                            gcc -Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup $@
                        fi
                    
                    Which would be configured in `.cargo/config` for supported targets:

                        [target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
                        linker = "./.cargo/linker-script.sh"

                    The content of `.cargo/pgx-dynamic-list.txt` would typically be:

                        { __pgx_internals_*; };
                    
                    Then, a `src/bin/sql-generator.rs` binary would exist with the following:

                        pgx::pg_binary_magic!(extension_name);

                    If `cargo pgx schema` does not detect these, it will create them automatically with defaults.
                    To skip writing defaults, use `-m`, to overwrite exiting files with these defaults, use `-f`.
                        
                    Finally, `lib.crate-type` should be set in `Cargo.toml`:
                    
                        [lib]
                        crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
                    
                    `cargo pgx schema` does not update your `Cargo.toml`, this must be manually set.
